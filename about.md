So my name is Sinead. Im a software developer. And technical debt makes me uncomfortable  

Apart from that there is nothing strange or startling about me. 

I created this site as a way of experimenting with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so there is nothing amazing going on here but feel free to have a little look around. You may as well. You are here now.
