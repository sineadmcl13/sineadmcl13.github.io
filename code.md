Some of the code I've written can be found on [Github](https://github.com/sineadmcl13). Feel free to have a nosy and fork any repository. I'm also very open to suggestions and advice on improving my code so don't hesitate to send a pull request as well

There are also solutions to some of the problems found on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). I quite like the challenge of these puzzles. Need to get back to doing some more soon
